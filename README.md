App Description:

This is a newsletter web application that enables users to sign up for newsletters.
Once the user gets to the website, they are prompted to input their firstname, lastname and email.
Upon doing so, their email is added to the app's subscribers list on Mailchimp.
The application is integrated with the Mailchimp Marketing API and runs on the Node Server.

The code was built in Javascript using Express Library, HTTPS, BodyParser, Mailchimp and Request in order
to make the connection betweeen the Mailchimp API and the Newsletter App work.
